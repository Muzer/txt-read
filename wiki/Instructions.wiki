These are the instructions for the use of my app


= Details =

To load it, you must use an app that lets you specify arguments. This currently means wiiload. So, it would be:

wiiload txt-read.dol file.txt

where file.txt is on the SD card.

The app will then ask you if you want to display line numbers. Press 1 for yes or 2 for no.

Then you can use up and down to scroll, and home to exit.

Simple, eh?
